# About Our Code and Dataset Release

We are currently in the process of meticulously organizing our experimental code and preparing the Camera Ready version of our paper. Rest assured that our codes and datasets will be made publicly available very soon. Stay tuned for updates!

# Acknowledgement  
Our dataset is extended based on the methods from [RIVEG](https://github.com/JinYuanLi0012/RiVEG) and [PGIM](https://github.com/JinYuanLi0012/PGIM) on the [MNRE dataset](https://github.com/thecharm/MNRE) and [MORE dataset](https://github.com/NJUNLP/MORE), followed by manual annotation and correction of relational triplets.  
Our code is built upon the open-sourced [HVFormer](https://github.com/liuxiyang641/HVFormer) and [MOREformer](https://github.com/NJUNLP/MORE). Thanks for their great work!
